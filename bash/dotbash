# Common aliases for ease of use:
alias ll='ls -alF'       # Long listing format with hidden files
alias la='ls -A'         # List all files except . and ..
alias l='ls -CF'         # Column listing format
alias grep='grep --color=auto'  # Highlight matches in grep for better readability

# Command history settings:
# Show timestamps in history (date and time)
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
# Append to the history file instead of overwriting it after each session
shopt -s histappend
# Increase the history size to store more commands (optional based on your preference)
HISTSIZE=5000
HISTFILESIZE=10000

# Informational Comments:
# - The PATH variable adds the directories for executables to be found.
# - Bash completion enables enhanced terminal functionality.
# - The PS1 prompt is customized to show Git info, and the return code of the last command, which is helpful for debugging.
# - Aliases make commonly used commands shorter and more intuitive.
# - The history settings ensure command history is timestamped, persistent across sessions, and stores a large number of commands.
